# What Is This?
This project is a passion project to create a text based Role Playing Game engine, using only PowerShell and WinForms. The goal is to be able to create basic text based RPGs. The goal mostly is to stretch my PowerShell skills, and software design and architechture principles.

# Can I contribute?
No. This comment is meant for personal skill development and practice at this time. However, this may change in the future.

# Can I use this?
Once it is feature ready, the tool will be released in an .EXE wrapped from this GitHub repo. Feel free to use it when that time comes.

#Can I log issues?
Yes, please log issues for feature requests and bug notes. However, keep in mind this is a side passion project, so development will be slow, and some features may not be implemented due to time constraints.

# Can I contact you?
Yes. However, I do not often check my GitHub messages.
